## üöÄ Overview

**Batch Image Resizer** is a lightweight yet powerful macOS utility that allows you to resize, compress, and process hundreds of photos at once. Designed for photographers, designers, marketers, and everyday users, it saves time by automating repetitive image editing tasks.  

Instead of opening each photo in a full-featured editor, you can simply drag and drop entire folders into Batch Image Resizer. The app will instantly resize them to your chosen dimensions, apply compression settings, and export them in your desired format. Whether you need images optimized for web, mobile apps, social media, or documentation, this tool ensures consistency across all files.  

Beyond resizing, the app includes advanced options such as maintaining aspect ratios, batch renaming, watermarking, and format conversions (JPEG, PNG, TIFF, BMP, HEIC). Professionals can create presets for different projects, while casual users can quickly reduce file sizes for emailing or cloud storage.  

Batch Image Resizer is optimized for macOS, offering a clean interface, drag-and-drop support, and blazing-fast performance even with large batches of images. It‚Äôs the perfect solution for anyone managing large photo libraries or preparing content for publishing workflows.
